    \section*{Faster fitting for joint models of survival and multivariate longitudinal data}

    % Introduction, \ie brief summary of what we set out to do -->
    Some twenty-five years after the first introduction of joint modelling in \citet{Wulfsohn97}, clinical trials across multiple disease areas routinely collect information on many longitudinal biomarkers. This represents challenges and opportunities: Multivariate data likely provides better discrimination capabilities from a prediction standpoint, furthermore disregarding the multivariate nature of the data is tantamount to ignoring potentially informative correlations between these longitudinal trajectories; on the other hand, the multidimensional integrals which arise as part of parameter estimation under traditional approaches presents significant computational and statistical difficulties.

    % `One line' summary of thesis -->
    This thesis investigates alternative approaches which enable faster fitting of joint models of survival and \textit{multivariate} longitudinal data. An approximate EM algorithm relatively dormant in the literature \citep{Bernhardt15} is repurposed to lessen the computational burden felt by traditional joint models, leading to faster fitting. Furthermore, we extended beyond the typically-used restrictive longitudinal specifications in such models in favour of flexible, potentially complex specifications.
