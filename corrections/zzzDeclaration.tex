    The work presented in Chapter \ref{cha:approx} is based on the publication Murray, J., Philipson, P., 2022. \textit{A fast approximate EM algorithm for joint models of survival and multivariate longitudinal data}. Computational Statistics \& Data Analysis 170, 107438.

    The work presented in Chapter \ref{cha:flexible}, and to a lesser extent Chapter \ref{cha:justification}, is based on the publication Murray, J., Philipson, P., 2023. \textit{Fast estimation for generalised multivariate joint models using an approximate EM algorithm}. Computational Statistics \& Data Analysis 187, 107819.

    The work presented in Chapters \ref{cha:intro} and \ref{cha:methods-classic} borrows small parts from both of the above publications.
