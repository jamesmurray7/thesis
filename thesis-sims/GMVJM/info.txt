% GMVJM ================================
% Mixture of response distns ===========
% ======================================

Something like ...? -->

-- Set K=3 {Gaussian/Poisson/Binomial} as the "default scenario".
   since these are the "de facto" distributions to consider for continuous/
   count/binary data respectively.
-- Can then expand to case where there are lots of these types of data (
   say straight to K=7).
-- Then, make these models a little more complex, by introducing _global_ 
   dispersion models (from any families).
-- Then at final stages: Make these arbitrarily complex e.g. time-dependent
   dispersion models;
-- and increase K again.

--> Should provide a reasonable `review' of GMVJM capabilities.
