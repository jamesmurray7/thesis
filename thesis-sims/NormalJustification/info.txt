% NormalJustification =========================
% Seeking to empirically argue by simulation  =
% that the normal approximation used through- =
% -out is justified.                          = 
% =============================================

For each family considered in the thesis: 
* Gaussian (already done?)
* Poisson
* Binomial
* Generalised Poisson
* Negative binomial

--> show that the justification holds over different
available lengths of follow-up and magnitude(s) of
variance component(s) diag(\D).

--> Try and illustrate `shape'/modal mass of some
expectations of interest.
