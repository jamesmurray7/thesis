This directory seeks only to compoare fitting capabilities against established methods:
1) joineRML (Hickey et al 2018) -- This method is most comparable to the approximate EM; so
   expect/hope parameter estimates line up.
2) JMbayes2 (Rizopoulous 2021) -- MCMC method. Expect these to be *better* (?) since gold standard 
   approach, but much slower than both joineRML and appx. EM.

Only multivariate joint models will be cosnidered. To that end, other joint model packages 
which are restricted to univariate case aren't considered (and would only bloat things anyway).
